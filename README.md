## üóÇÔ∏è How Caching Works
- The application refreshes its in-memory cache every 1 minute (60 seconds) using a background thread.

- Cache interval can be changed by modifying the time.sleep(60) line in the script.

---

## üîê Security & Notes
- Keep your API token secret!

- For internal use only‚Äîrestrict access to the dashboard as needed.

- For production, run behind a secure reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) and use HTTPS.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Customization
- Cache Interval:
  Change the refresh frequency by adjusting time.sleep(60) (in seconds).

- More Metrics:
  Add new endpoints by defining new Flask routes in the script.
